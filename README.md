- Emphasis on Lines of Effort (LOE) 2, 3, 4:
  2) "Improve the Delivery of Mental Health Care. Mental health is vital to every
Service member' s well-being and to the overall readiness of our force . It is our
solemn obligation to provide the best possible mental health care to our men and
women in uniform. In March 2023 , I approved the immediate implementation of 10
actions related to the SPRIRC recommendations for improving access to behavioral
and mental health care. To advance this line of effort, the Department will begin
implementing 24 additional SPRIRC recommendations to improve mental health
service delivery and achieve the following priorities:
    - Expand training programs and actions to better recruit, support, and retain
mental health providers.
    - Remove obstacles to improve coordination of care.
    - Eliminate barriers to provider pay equity, timely hiring, and efficient
on boarding.
    - Increase appointment availability by revising mental health staffing models to
ensure that mental health clinics have the administrative and case management
support they need.
  3) Address Stigma and Other Barriers to Care. The Department has taken important
actions to eliminate the stubborn stigma around asking for help, and we have helped
reduce barriers to seeking mental health care. The Office of the Under Secretary of
Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&R)) has conducted a comprehensive
review and revision of policies across the Department, working to eliminate
stigmatizing language. Additionally, the Department has issued guidance to
implement the Brandon Act, which allows Service members to self-initiate referrals
for mental health evaluations and seeks to promote a culture of reaching out for help.
To continue these efforts, the Department will begin implementing 14 approved
SPRIRC recommendations to advance the following objectives:
    - Expand availability of confidential services, including non-medical
counseling for suicide prevention.
    - Increase mental health services in primary care.
    - Expand availability of tele-health care and other digital tools.
    - Provide additional resources to support unit leaders in reducing stigma.
  4) Revise Suicide Prevention Training. The Department is undertaking a foundational
shift toward a comprehensive integrated prevention strategy, applying a public-health
approach to the prevention of harmful behaviors. This will help create healthier, more
supportive environments by enhancing protections for our communities and
eliminating risk factors. The implementation of the approved recommendations of the
Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military, specifically the
stand-up of the Integrated Primary Prevention Workforce, has been a core part of this
shift, as have our efforts to better educate Department leaders about prevention and
give them greater visibility into the data that can help them assess command climate.
Looking ahead, we need to build on the lessons learned and revise suicide prevention
training to focus more directly on stressors and risk factors that Service members face
