- Emphasis on Lines of Efforts (LOE) 2, 3, 4:

  - f) "Standard: Disclosures for Law Enforcement Purposes. A DoD covered entity may
disclose PHI for a law enforcement purpose to a law enforcement official if the conditions in
Paragraphs 4.4.f.(1) through 4.4.f.(7) are met, as applicable.
    (1) Permitted Disclosures: Pursuant to Process and as Otherwise Required By Law. A
DoD covered entity may disclose PHI:
      (a) As required by law including laws that require the reporting of certain types of
wounds or other physical injuries, except for laws subject to Paragraph 4.4.b.(1)(b) (reports of
child abuse and neglect) or 4.4.c.(1) (reports required by law of abuse, neglect, or domestic
violence).
      - (b) In compliance with, and as limited by, the relevant requirements of:
        - 1. A court order, court-ordered warrant, subpoena, or summons issued by a
judicial officer.
        - 2. A grand jury subpoena.
        - 3. An administrative request, including an administrative subpoena or summons,
a civil or an authorized investigative demand, or similar process authorized under law, if:
          - a. The information sought is relevant and material to a legitimate law
enforcement inquiry.
          - b. The request is in writing, specific, and limited in scope to the extent
reasonably practicable in light of the purpose for which the information is sought.
          - c. De-identified information could not reasonably be used.
    - (2) Permitted Disclosures: Limited Information for Identification and Location
Purposes. Except for disclosures required by law as permitted by Paragraph 4.4.f.(1)(a), a DoD
covered entity may disclose PHI in response to a law enforcement officialâ€™s request for such
information for the purpose of identifying or locating a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or
missing person, if:
      - (a) The DoD covered entity discloses only the following information.
          - 1. Name and address.
          - 2. Date and place of birth.
          - 3. Social security number.
          - 4. ABO blood type and rhesus factor.
          - 5. Type of injury.
          - 6. Date and time of treatment.
          - 7. Date and time of death, if applicable.
          - 8. A description of distinguishing physical characteristics, including height,
          weight, gender, race, hair and eye color, presence or absence of facial hair (beard or moustache),
          scars, and tattoos.
        - (b) Except as permitted by Paragraph 4.4.f.(2)(a), the DoD covered entity does not
        disclose for the purposes of identification or location under Paragraph 4.4.f.(2) any PHI related
        to the individualâ€™s deoxyribonucleic acid analysis, dental records, or typing, samples, or analysis
        of body fluids or tissue.
    - (3) Permitted Disclosure: Victims of a Crime. In addition to disclosures required by law
        as permitted by Paragraph 4.4.f.(1) or otherwise authorized under this section (such as
        disclosures for public health activities or disclosures about victims of abuse, neglect, or domestic
        violence), a DoD covered entity may disclose PHI in response to a law enforcement officialâ€™s
        request for such PHI about an individual who is or is suspected to be a victim of a crime (subject
        to the special rules for sexual assault and domestic abuse under Paragraph 4.4 f.(7)) if:
          - (a) The individual agrees to the disclosure; or
          - (b) The DoD covered entity is unable to obtain the individualâ€™s agreement because of
          incapacity or other emergency circumstance, provided that:
          - 1. The law enforcement official represents that such PHI is needed to determine
        whether a violation of law by a person other than the victim has occurred, and such PHI is not
        intended to be used against the victim.
          - 2. The law enforcement official represents that immediate law enforcement
        activity that depends upon the disclosure would be materially and adversely affected by waiting
        until the individual is able to agree to the disclosure.
          - 3. The disclosure is in the best interests of the individual as determined by the
        DoD covered entity, in the exercise of professional judgment.
    - (4) Permitted Disclosure: Decedents. A DoD covered entity may disclose PHI about an
        individual who has died to a law enforcement official for the purpose of alerting law
        enforcement of the death of the individual if the DoD covered entity has a suspicion that such
        death may have resulted from criminal conduct.
    - (5) Permitted Disclosure: Crime on Premises. A DoD covered entity may disclose to a
        law enforcement official PHI that the DoD covered entity believes in good faith constitutes
        evidence of criminal conduct that occurred on the premises of the DoD covered entity.
    - (6) Permitted Disclosure: Reporting Crime in Emergencies.
      - (a) A covered health care provider providing emergency health care in response to a
      medical emergency, other than such emergency on the premises of the covered health care
      provider, may disclose PHI to a law enforcement official if such disclosure appears necessary to
      alert law enforcement to:
        - 1. The commission and nature of a crime.
        - 2. The location of such crime or of the victim(s) of such crime.
        - 3. The identity, description, and location of the perpetrator of such crime.
      - (b) If a covered health care provider believes that the medical emergency described
      in Paragraph 4.4.f.(6)(a) is the result of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence of the individual in
      need of emergency health care, Paragraph 4.4.f.(6)(a) does not apply and any disclosure to a law
      enforcement official for law enforcement purposes is subject to Paragraph 4.4.c.
    - (7) Permitted Disclosure: Sexual Assault and Domestic Abuse Cases. In cases in which
    a victim of sexual assault or domestic abuse elects restricted reporting under DoDI 6495.02 or
    DoDI 6400.06, the limitations on disclosure under these issuances apply."
