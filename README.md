- Emphasis on Lines of Efforts (LOE) 2, 3, 4:

  2) "Improve the Delivery of Mental Health Care. Mental health is vital to every
Service member' s well-being and to the overall readiness of our force . It is our
solemn obligation to provide the best possible mental health care to our men and
women in uniform. In March 2023 , I approved the immediate implementation of 10
actions related to the SPRIRC recommendations for improving access to behavioral
and mental health care. To advance this line of effort, the Department will begin
implementing 24 additional SPRIRC recommendations to improve mental health
service delivery and achieve the following priorities:
    - Expand training programs and actions to better recruit, support, and retain
mental health providers.
    - Remove obstacles to improve coordination of care.
    - Eliminate barriers to provider pay equity, timely hiring, and efficient
on boarding.
    - Increase appointment availability by revising mental health staffing models to
ensure that mental health clinics have the administrative and case management
support they need.
  3) Address Stigma and Other Barriers to Care. The Department has taken important
actions to eliminate the stubborn stigma around asking for help, and we have helped
reduce barriers to seeking mental health care. The Office of the Under Secretary of
Defense for Personnel and Readiness (USD(P&R)) has conducted a comprehensive
review and revision of policies across the Department, working to eliminate
stigmatizing language. Additionally, the Department has issued guidance to
implement the Brandon Act, which allows Service members to self-initiate referrals
for mental health evaluations and seeks to promote a culture of reaching out for help.
To continue these efforts, the Department will begin implementing 14 approved
SPRIRC recommendations to advance the following objectives:
    - Expand availability of confidential services, including non-medical
counseling for suicide prevention.
    - Increase mental health services in primary care.
    - Expand availability of tele-health care and other digital tools.
    - Provide additional resources to support unit leaders in reducing stigma.
  4) Revise Suicide Prevention Training. The Department is undertaking a foundational
shift toward a comprehensive integrated prevention strategy, applying a public-health
approach to the prevention of harmful behaviors. This will help create healthier, more
supportive environments by enhancing protections for our communities and
eliminating risk factors. The implementation of the approved recommendations of the
Independent Review Commission on Sexual Assault in the Military, specifically the
stand-up of the Integrated Primary Prevention Workforce, has been a core part of this
shift, as have our efforts to better educate Department leaders about prevention and
give them greater visibility into the data that can help them assess command climate.
Looking ahead, we need to build on the lessons learned and revise suicide prevention
training to focus more directly on stressors and risk factors that Service members face
daily. To deepen our work in this area, we will begin implementing 20 approved
SPRIRC recommendations to modernize the Department's suicide prevention and
postvention training. The Defense Suicide Prevention Office will develop the core
curriculum for this revised training, which will allow for tailoring to meet the unique
needs of each of the Military Services, to include the National Guard and Reserve.
These revisions are intended to:
    - Modernize content, delivery, and dosage of suicide prevention training.
    - Train behavioral health technicians in evidence-based practices.
    - Integrate leaders at all levels into suicide prevention training.
    - Centralize the core suicide prevention training curriculum."

child abuse and neglect) or 4.4.c.(1) (reports required by law of abuse, neglect, or domestic
violence).
      - (b) In compliance with, and as limited by, the relevant requirements of:
        - 1. A court order, court-ordered warrant, subpoena, or summons issued by a
judicial officer.
        - 2. A grand jury subpoena.

information for the purpose of identifying or locating a suspect, fugitive, material witness, or
missing person, if:
      - (a) The DoD covered entity discloses only the following information.
          - 1. Name and address.
          - 2. Date and place of birth.
          - 3. Social security number.

        - (b) Except as permitted by Paragraph 4.4.f.(2)(a), the DoD covered entity does not
        disclose for the purposes of identification or location under Paragraph 4.4.f.(2) any PHI related

        of body fluids or tissue.
    - (3) Permitted Disclosure: Victims of a Crime. In addition to disclosures required by law
        as permitted by Paragraph 4.4.f.(1) or otherwise authorized under this section (such as
        disclosures for public health activities or disclosures about victims of abuse, neglect, or domestic
        violence), a DoD covered entity may disclose PHI in response to a law enforcement officialâ€™s
        request for such PHI about an individual who is or is suspected to be a victim of a crime (subject
        to the special rules for sexual assault and domestic abuse under Paragraph 4.4 f.(7)) if:
          - (a) The individual agrees to the disclosure; or
          - (b) The DoD covered entity is unable to obtain the individualâ€™s agreement because of
          incapacity or other emergency circumstance, provided that:
          - 1. The law enforcement official represents that such PHI is needed to determine
        whether a violation of law by a person other than the victim has occurred, and such PHI is not
        intended to be used against the victim.
          - 2. The law enforcement official represents that immediate law enforcement
        activity that depends upon the disclosure would be materially and adversely affected by waiting
        until the individual is able to agree to the disclosure.
          - 3. The disclosure is in the best interests of the individual as determined by the
        DoD covered entity, in the exercise of professional judgment.
    - (4) Permitted Disclosure: Decedents. A DoD covered entity may disclose PHI about an
        individual who has died to a law enforcement official for the purpose of alerting law
        enforcement of the death of the individual if the DoD covered entity has a suspicion that such
        death may have resulted from criminal conduct.
    - (5) Permitted Disclosure: Crime on Premises. A DoD covered entity may disclose to a
        law enforcement official PHI that the DoD covered entity believes in good faith constitutes
        evidence of criminal conduct that occurred on the premises of the DoD covered entity.
    - (6) Permitted Disclosure: Reporting Crime in Emergencies.
      - (a) A covered health care provider providing emergency health care in response to a
      medical emergency, other than such emergency on the premises of the covered health care
      provider, may disclose PHI to a law enforcement official if such disclosure appears necessary to
      alert law enforcement to:
        - 1. The commission and nature of a crime.
        - 2. The location of such crime or of the victim(s) of such crime.
        - 3. The identity, description, and location of the perpetrator of such crime.
      - (b) If a covered health care provider believes that the medical emergency described
      in Paragraph 4.4.f.(6)(a) is the result of abuse, neglect, or domestic violence of the individual in
      need of emergency health care, Paragraph 4.4.f.(6)(a) does not apply and any disclosure to a law
      enforcement official for law enforcement purposes is subject to Paragraph 4.4.c.
    - (7) Permitted Disclosure: Sexual Assault and Domestic Abuse Cases. In cases in which
    a victim of sexual assault or domestic abuse elects restricted reporting under DoDI 6495.02 or

- [Military Command Exception](https://www.health.mil/Military-Health-Topics/Privacy-and-Civil-Liberties/HIPAA-Compliance-within-the-MHS/Military-Command-Exception)
  - Under the Military Command Exception, a covered entity may disclose the PHI of Service members for authorized
  activities to appropriate military command authorities. It is important to note that this exception does not require
  covered entities to disclose PHI to commanders, it only permits the disclosure. If disclosure is made, then only the
  minimum amount of information necessary should be provided. Further, the Exception does not permit a
  Commander’s direct access to a Service member’s electronic medical record, unless otherwise authorized by the
  Service member or the HIPAA Privacy Rule.
  - Appropriate military command authorities include commanders who exercise authority over a Service member, or
another person designated by a commander.
  -Authorized activities for which PHI may be disclosed to a commander include but are not limited to:
    - Determining the member's fitness for duty;
    - Fitness to perform a particular assignment; or
    - Carrying out any other activity essential for the military mission
  - Mental Health and/or Substance Misuse
  - To dispel stigma around Service members seeking mental health care or voluntary substance misuse education,
DoDI 6490.08 was issued to balance patient confidentiality rights with the commander’s need to make informed
operational and risk management decisions.
  - DoD healthcare providers shall not notify a Service member’s commander when the member obtains mental
health care and/or substance misuse education services – unless one of the below conditions or circumstances
apply. If they apply, then disclosure is required.
    - Harm to self. There is a serious risk of self‐harm by the member.
    - Harm to others. There is a serious risk of harm to others. This includes any disclosures concerning child
abuse or domestic violence.
    - Harm to mission. There is a serious risk of harm to a specific military mission.
    - Special personnel. The member is in the Personnel Reliability Program or has mission responsibilities of
such potential sensitivity or urgency that normal notification standards would significantly risk mission
accomplishment.
    - Inpatient care. The member is admitted or discharged from any inpatient mental health or substance
misuse treatment facility.
    - Acute medical conditions interfering with duty. The member is experiencing an acute mental health
condition or is engaged in an acute medical treatment regimen that impairs the member’s ability to
perform assigned duties.
    - Substance misuse treatment program. The member has entered into, or is being discharged from, a formal
outpatient or inpatient treatment program for the treatment of substance misuse.
    - Command‐directed mental health evaluation. The mental health services are obtained as a result of a
command‐directed mental health evaluation.
    - Other special circumstances. The notification is based on other special circumstances in which proper
execution of the military mission outweighs the interests served by avoiding notification, as determined
on a case‐by‐case basis by a covered entity.
  - If one of these circumstances or conditions applies, DoDI 6490.08 makes the disclosure to the commander
permitted AND required.
  - Substance Misuse Records
  - Covered entities shall follow the special rules in 42 CFR Part 2 regarding confidentiality of substance
misuse patient records.

  - Mil.R.Evd. 513 established this privilege in the military. A patient has the privilege to prevent the disclosure of any
  confidential communications made between the patient and a psychotherapist, or an assistant to the psychotherapist,
  if the communication was made to facilitate diagnosis or treatment of the patient’s mental health condition. Patient
  records that pertain to any such communications between a patient and a psychotherapist are included in the
  privilege.
  Psychotherapist is defined as a psychiatrist, clinical psychologist, or any clinical social worker licensed to provide
  mental health services in any state, territory or possession of the United States. The privilege may be claimed by the
  patient, or by the psychotherapist on behalf of the patient. The rule has eight (8) exceptions to the privilege, some
  seemingly very broad. There is no privilege when:
    1. The patient is dead
    2. The communication is evidence of spouse abuse, child abuse or neglect, or in a proceeding when one
    spouse is charged with a crime against the other spouse
    3. Federal law, state law, or service regulation imposes a duty to report information contained in a
    communication.
    4. The psychotherapist believes that a patient’s mental condition makes the patient a danger to any person,
    including the patient.
    5. The communication clearly contemplated the commission of a future crime or fraud, or the
    psychotherapist’s services are sought to assist anyone in planning or committing what the patient knew or
    reasonably should have known to be a crime or fraud.
    6. It is necessary to ensure the safety and security of military personnel, military dependents, military
    property, classified information or the accomplishment of a military mission.
    7. When an accused offers statements or other evidence concerning his mental condition in defense,
    extenuation or mitigation.
    8. The admission or disclosure of the communication is constitutionally required.
  - It is highly recommended that when a legal officer identifies communications that are privileged under this rule, he
    or she seek the assistance of a judge advocate before applying any of the exceptions to force the disclosure of the
    communication in question.
